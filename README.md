# Project 2 - *NYTimesSearch*

**NYTimesSearch** is an android app that allows a user to search for articles on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **~15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **search for news article** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the New York Times Search API.
* [x] User can **scroll down to see more articles**. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.
* [x] User can tap on any image in results to see the full text of article **full-screen**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box
* [x] User can **share an article link** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [x] Improved the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring
* [x] User can click on "filter icon" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
  * [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
    * [x] Begin Date (using a date picker)
    * [x] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports)
    * [x] Sort order (oldest or newest)
  * [x] Subsequent searches have any selected filters applied to the results
* [x] Replaces the default ActionBar with a [Toolbar](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar).
* [x] Replace `GridView` with the [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) and the `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` to improve the grid of image results displayed.
      This took awhile to implement.
* [x] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable leveraging the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
-RecyclerView took a long time to implement. Had numerous, obscure errors in implementing Filters. Link for alternative image was found to not work at last second...
